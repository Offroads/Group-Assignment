# Group-Assignment

This is the INFO284 group assignment 1. 
Submitted by candidates 110 and 21.

Upon starting the program you are expected to provide the path to the dataset. For example:
C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Group-Assignment\Data

It is assumed in the code that the paths to the test and training data is as follows:

\Data\test\neg

\Data\train\pos

"Data" can be anything, for example "aclImdb" as it was in the dataset given to us. But the rest of the folder structure must be in the same structure as it was when handed out. If the reviews are compressed to a zip file, they must be extracted.

To run, navigate to the directory that contains the python code.
On windows:

cd C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub\Group-assignment

Then run main

python main.py

and use the commands in the CLI.

Required packages:
stop-words

It can easily be installed with pip:

pip install stop-words
