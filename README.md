# Group-Assignment

This is our INFO284 group assignment so far.
It is expected that the paths to the reviews are as in the following examples:

Group-Assignment\Data\test\neg

Group-Assignment\Data\train\pos

Where Group-Assignment is the directory that the python source files are located.

To test, just run testing.py


We know that the way we calculate the probability currently is incorrect. Any advice is welcomed.
